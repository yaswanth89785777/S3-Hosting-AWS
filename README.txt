Hosting a static website using S3 bucket in AWS
------------------------------------------------


1.The index.html file i had uploaded here is the file which i created in s3 bucket.
2.Now to host this static website we need to make certain changes needed.
3.After making changes finally you will be getting the object URL which will be shared.
4.From that object URL we can see the hosted static website

here is my Object URL:
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sunil.awsbucket/index.html

from this we can conclude that we have successfully hosted a static webpage in using AWS
